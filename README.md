# 🌸 DermalScan – AI Facial Aging Detection System

**DermalScan** is an intelligent AI-based web application that analyzes facial images to detect signs of aging such as **wrinkles**, **dark spots**, and **puffy eyes**, while also identifying **clear skin**.  
The project combines **deep learning (InceptionV3)** and **computer vision** to provide accurate visual and tabular insights into facial aging patterns.

---

## 💡 Objective
To build a user-friendly system capable of detecting and analyzing visible facial aging indicators using an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN).

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🧍 Automatic **face detection** using OpenCV Haar Cascade.  
- 🧠 Deep learning-based classification of aging signs.  
- 📊 Downloadable **CSV report** containing predictions and confidence scores.  
- 🖼️ Annotated output images with bounding boxes and labels.  
- ⚙️ Intuitive Streamlit-based web interface.
